You\'re in ruins One, twenty one guns Lay down your arms Give up the fight One, twenty one guns Throw up your arms into the sky, You and I When you\'re at the end of the road And you lost all sense of control And your thoughts have taken their toll When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul Your faith walks on broken glass And the hangover doesn\'t pass Nothing\'s ever built to last You\'re in ruins One, twenty one guns Lay down your arms Give up the fight One, twenty one guns Throw up your arms into the sky, You and I Did you try to live on your own When you burned down the house and home? Did you stand too close to the fire? Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone When it\'s time to live and let die And you can\'t get another try Something inside this heart has died You\'re in ruins One, twenty one guns Lay down your arms Give up the fight One, twenty one guns Throw up your arms into the sky, One, twenty one guns Lay down your arms Give up the fight One, twenty one guns Throw up your arms into the sky, You and I', '21guns.jpg', 'Green Day - 21 Guns.mp3'),
